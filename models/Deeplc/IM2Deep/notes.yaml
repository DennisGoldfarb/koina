  IM2Deep was trained (81%), validated (9%) and tested (10%) on ~1.2M unique peptidoform-charge pairs, originating from three different data sets: PXD019086, PXD038782 and PXD042416. 
  To account for experimental drifts between the two data sets, we aligned them by calculating the linear offset (y = ax + b) between overlapping peptide-charge state pairs, as previously described. 
  The first data set includes 718,917 unique combinations of peptide sequence, charge state, and, where applicable, modifications (methionine oxidation, cysteine carbamidomethylation, and N-terminal acetylation). 
  The second data set, described in (24), contains 5,202 unique peptidoform-charge state combinations and features a broader range of modifications, including a distinction between symmetrical and asymmetrical arginine dimethylation. 
  Since IM2Deep cannot differentiate isomeric peptides, the mean CCS value of these isomers was used for dimethylated peptide-charge state pairs. 
  The last data set consists of 437.479 unique (modified) peptide-charge pairs, most of which are non-tryptic, and contain a larger range of charge states (1-6). 
  Evaluation on the test set demonstrated a mean absolute error of 6.26 Å², a median relative error of 0.91%, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.996.
  The model was initialized with random weights drawn from a normal distribution (μ=0.0, σ=1.0), and training was conducted on a single NVIDIA Geforce RTX 4090 GPU for up to 300 epochs, with early stopping employed to prevent overfitting.
