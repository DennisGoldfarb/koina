  IM2Deep, is a deep learning-based peptide collisional cross section (CCS) predictor that uses a similar architecture to the retention time predictor, DeepLC. 
  As a result, IM2Deep is able to predict CCS values for both unmodified as well as modified peptides, even if those modifications were not seen during training.
