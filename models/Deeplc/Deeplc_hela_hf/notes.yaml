## Data

- ** What is the source of the data used to train the model? **

The DeepLC HeLa HF model was trained from random parameters on 161 193 tryptic peptides. Modifications for this model include carbamidomethyl, oxidation of methionine, and N-terminal acetylation. 
  
The data is presented in <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00602">10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00602</a> and available at <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006932">PXD006932</a>. The data was processed with MaxQuant v1.5.8.3 and the obtained LC retention apex was used as its retention time target. The HeLa cell line was run on a reversed phase column with 30 minutes gradients using standard mobile phase composition. For all details please see the original publication reffered to at the start of this paragrpah. 

- ** What type of molecules does the training data represent? **

The training data represents tryptic peptides with modifications carbamidomethyl, oxidation of methionine, and N-terminal acetylation.

- ** How well does the training data represent the complexity of the molecular class the model is intended for? **

The model is intended for tryptic peptides with modifications carbamidomethyl, oxidation of methionine, and N-terminal acetylation. Any modifications that are not too much out of the chemical space of natural occuring amino acids should be predicted with relatively high accuracy.

- ** Was the data acquired on similar instruments/settings or across diverse conditions? **

The data was acquired in the same lab with the same instruments and settings.

- ** What are the limitations of the training data? **

Modification space is limited and are limited to similar chromatographic conditions (reversed phase column and ACN+FA+H2O based mobile phase).

- ** Were there known false positives/negatives in the training data? **

FDR filter was set for identifications was set to 1%.

- ** How might they affect performance? **

The model is expected to be robust against this small number of false positives/negatives.

- ** Were there instrument performance issues during data acquisition? **

No known issues.

- ** How might they impact test-set performance? **

## Optimization
- **What is the optimization target?**  

The optimization target is to minimize the mean absolute error between the predicted and observed retention times.

- **How does claimed performance compare to experimental variability?**  

The claimed performance is higher than the experimental variability with 1.7% relative mean absolute error (normalized against the delta of first and last identified peptide).

- **What metric is used for chromatogram/spectra comparison?**  

Apex of the extracted ion chromatogram compared against the predicted retention time. Other metrics for performance evaluation are the Pearson correlation coefficient and the 95th error percentile.

## Model
- **Is the model interpretable or a black box?**  

The model is a black box, but can be interrogated with methods such as saliency maps and SHAP.

- **If interpretable, how can it be interpreted?**  

The model can be interrogated with methods such as saliency maps and SHAP to study retention behavior.

- **Is the model classification or regression?**  

Regression model.

- **How long does a single prediction take?**  

A million predictions take about 1 minute. So a single prediction is ~6.0e-5 seconds.

- **What are the model’s limitations?**  

The model is limited to reversed phase chromatography with ACN+FA+H2O based mobile phase. The model is expected to have optimal performance for tryptic peptides with modifications carbamidomethyl, oxidation of methionine, and N-terminal acetylation. It can interpolate and extraplote to different types of peptides.

## Evaluation
- **What performance measures are reported?**  

Mean absolute error, Pearson correlation coefficient, and 95th error percentile.

- **Why were these measures chosen?**  

These measures are chosen to evaluate the model's performance in predicting retention times.

- **If reporting a single performance number, how is it justified?**  

-

- **Is a confusion matrix available?**  

No.

- **Was performance compared to simpler baseline methods?**  

Yes.

- **How was the model evaluated?**  

The model was evaluated on a test set that was not used during training and on independent data sets.

- **Has it been tested on independent data from different instruments/labs?**

Yes.

- **For RT prediction: What improvement in ID/quantification does it imply?**  

Increase in identification is expected to be be between 1-2%. Specificity in identification and quantification is substantially improved. This largely depends on the proteomics experiment, especially for complex search spaces it is expected to improve more than the previous mentioned numbers. 

- **Does the model use input from other ML algorithms?**  

No.

- **Were precursor ion peaks excluded during spectra comparison?**  

No.

- **Is performance highly variable?**

No.

- **Applicability scope:** What data types work, and which don’t?  

LC-MS/MS data with reversed phase chromatography and ACN+FA+H2O based mobile phase.

- **Known performance issues users should be aware of?**  

No.


## Other

  The data was randomly split into a training (137 821), validation (7 252), and test (16 120) split. The validation split was used for early stopping of the model. The data and split information is available <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41592-021-01301-5/MediaObjects/41592_2021_1301_MOESM3_ESM.csv">here</a>. The final model (available here) was trained on the combination of training and testing sets combined, the validation set was still used for early stopping.
