  The DeepLC HeLa HF model was trained from random parameters on 161 193 tryptic peptides. Modifications for this model include carbamidomethyl, oxidation of methionine, and N-terminal acetylation. 
  
  The data is presented in <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00602">10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00602</a> and available at <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006932">PXD006932</a>. The data was processed with MaxQuant v1.5.8.3 and the obtained LC retention apex was used as its retention time target. The HeLa cell line was run on a reversed phase column with 30 minutes gradients using standard mobile phase composition. For all details please see the original publication reffered to at the start of this paragrpah. 

  This DeepLC model uses a convolutional deep learning architecture with four paths processing the same encoded peptide. Three paths combine convolutional and max pooling layers to capture and generalize local structural features. The fourth path consists of densely connected layers that capture global features without considering local structures. Outputs from all four pathways are flattened, concatenated, and fed into a final combined pathway of six dense layers.

  The data was randomly split into a training (137 821), validation (7 252), and test (16 120) split. The validation split was used for early stopping of the model. The data and split information is available <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41592-021-01301-5/MediaObjects/41592_2021_1301_MOESM3_ESM.csv">here</a>. The final model (available here) was trained on the combination of training and testing sets combined, the validation set was still used for early stopping.
