  Altimeter predicts HCD MS2 spectra for peptides. This particular model computes fragment isotope intensities by re-isotoping the total abundance spectra from Altimeter_2024_intensities given the isolation efficiencies of an isolation window. Fragment isotope distributions are quickly approximated using the sulfur-specific spline method described in https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.8b01649. Intensities are normalized by the base peak for each spectrum The fragments are sorted by their intensities and the top 1000 fragments are returned.
  Altimeter was trained on the ProteomeTools dataset (tryptic, lysC, aspN, and HLA) that was re-processed in-house. The dataset was split 70/20/10 at the peptide level for training, validation, and testing. It achieved a median normalized spectral angle of 0.941 on the test set.

  Input limits:<ul><li>Length: 6-40 amino acids (6-30 recommended).</li><li>Charge: 1-7 (1-4 recommended).</li><li>PTMs: Variable oxidation of methionines and static carbamidomethylation of cysteines.</li><li>NCEs: 20-40.</li><li>Isolated precursor isotopes: M0-M4. Given as 5 numbers between 0-1 representing the isolation efficiency of the corresponding precursor isotope.</li></ul>
