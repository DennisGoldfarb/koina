description: | 
  A deep learning model  based on the architecture of Prosit, specifically trained to predict retention time of citrullinated and deamidated peptides, 
  as well as unmodified peptides. The model leverages the same neural network framework as Prosit but has been extended to accommodate post-translational modifications (PTMs), 
  particularly citrullination and deamidation.

  The training dataset consisted of synthetic peptides from the ProteomeTools project, including a total of 17.5 million spectra. 
  These were divided into training (~525K peptides), validation (~150K peptides), and test sets (~75K peptides). 
  The complete dataset is publicly accessible here: https://zenodo.org/records/13856705.

  When evaluated on the test set, the model achieved a delta RT 95 of 140 sec (R = 0.99) for citrullinated peptides and a delta RT 95 of 75 sec (R = 0.99) for unmodified peptides, 
  indicating high predictive accuracy for both modified and unmodified peptides.
