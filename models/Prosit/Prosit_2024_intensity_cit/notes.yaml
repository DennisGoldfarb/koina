description: |
  A deep learning model  based on the architecture of Prosit, specifically trained to predict fragment ion intensities of citrullinated and deamidated peptides, 
  as well as unmodified peptides. The model leverages the same neural network framework as Prosit but has been extended to accommodate post-translational modifications (PTMs), 
  particularly citrullination and deamidation.

  The training dataset consisted of synthetic peptides from the ProteomeTools project, including a total of 17.5 million spectra. 
  These were divided into training (~12.2M spectra), validation (~3.5M spectra), and test sets (~1.7M spectra). 
  The complete dataset is publicly accessible here: https://zenodo.org/records/13856705.

  When evaluated on the test set, the model achieved a spectral angle of 0.85 (R = 0.97) for citrullinated peptides and a spectral angle of 0.92 (R = 0.99) for unmodified peptides, 
  indicating high predictive accuracy for both modified and unmodified peptides.
