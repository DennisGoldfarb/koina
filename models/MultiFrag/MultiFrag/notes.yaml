  MultiFrag is a Prosit model trained jointly on 5 different types of fragmentation spectra -> HCD, ECD, EID, UVPD, and ETciD. The model outputs 813 ion types, which include ion series a, a+proton, b, c, c+proton, x, x+proton, y, z, z+proton, up to length 29 and product charge +3. The model can be run on peptide lengths up through 30, and precursor charges up through 6. The allowed modifications are N-terminal acetylation ([UNIMOD:1]) and Oxidation ([UNIMOD:35]). Carbamidomethylation is fixed on Cysteine. You must always include its Unimod code, in a peptide sequence with cysteine -> C[UNIMOD:4]. The fragmentation methods are also included as input to the model, input as strings ("HCD", "ECD", "EID", "UVPD", "ETciD"). MultiFrag outputs all 815 ion intensities, their string annotations, and the ions' m/z's, with impossible ions (too long or too high product charge) having m/z=-1.0.
