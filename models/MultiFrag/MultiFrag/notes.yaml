  MultiFrag is a Prosit model trained jointly on 4 different types of fragmentation spectra -> HCD, ECD, EID, and UVPD. The model outputs 813 ion types, which include ion series a, a+proton, b, c, c+proton, x, x+proton, y, z, z+proton, upto length 29 and product charge +3. The model can be run on peptide lengths up through 30, and precursor charges up through 6. The allowed modifications are N-terminal acetylation ([UNIMOD:1]) and Oxidation ([UNIMOD:35]). Carbamidomethylation is fixed on Cysteine. You must always include its Unimod code, in a peptide sequence with cysteine -> C[UNIMOD:4]. The fragmentation methods are also included as input to the model, input as all-caps strings ("HCD", "ECD", "EID", "UVPD"). MultiFrag outputs all 813 ion intensities, their string annotations, and the ions' m/z's, with impossible ions (too long or too high product charge) having m/z=-1.0.
