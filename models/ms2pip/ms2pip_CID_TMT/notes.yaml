description: |
  This model was trained on observed spectrum intensities from 72,138 unique TMT-labeled peptides. MS2 spectra were acquired in the ion trap with CID fragmentation (trap-type CID). 
  Raw train/test and evaluation data are available via PRIDE, with the identifiers PXD041002 and PXD005890, respectively. Processed data is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7833635.
  Modifications on the input peptide are only considered for the MS2 peak m/z values. Prediction accuracy for peptides with other modifications may vary and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Predicted intensities will always assume TMT labeling, regardless of the input modification state.

  **Input notes**
  All modifcations need to be explicitly encoded in the sequence. Valid sequences lengths are up to 30 AA. Supported are all modification from UNIMOD but modifications are only used to shift fragment mz they do not affect intensity.
  There are no limitations to valid Precursor Charges.
  
  **Output notes**
  Intensity was normalized to the sum of predicted intensity value.
  The model predicts y and b ions index 1-30 and charge 1. A maks is applied for impossible peaks (i.e. exceeding peptide length).
