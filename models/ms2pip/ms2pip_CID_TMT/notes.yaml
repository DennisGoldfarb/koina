  This model was trained on observed spectrum intensities from 72,138 unique TMT-labeled peptides.
  MS2 spectra were acquired ion the ion trap with CID fragmentation (trap-type CID). Raw rain/test
  and evaluation data are available via PRIDE, with the identifiers PXD041002 and PXD005890,
  respectively. Processed data is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7833635.
  Predicted intensities will always assume TMT labeling, regardless of the input modification
  state. Modifications on the input peptide are only considered for the MS2 peak m/z values.
  Prediction accuracy for peptides with other modifications may vary and should be evaluated on a
  case-by-case basis.

    **Input notes**
  All modifcations need to be explicitly encoded in the sequence. Valid sequences lengths are 1 to 40 AA. Supported are all modification from UNIMOD but modifications are only used to shift fragment mz they do not affect intensity.
  There are no limitations to valid Precursor Charges.
  
  **Output notes**
  Intensity was normalized to the sum of predicted intensity value.
  The model predicts y and b ions index 1-30 and charge 1. A maks is applied for impossible peaks (i.e. exceeding peptide length).
