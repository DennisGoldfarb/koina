  The peak intensity models were trained using timsTOF data from two different labs. This dataset
  includes peptides from JY (trypsin and elastase digests) and HeLa (trypsin digests), as well as
  HLA class I immunoprecipitation-enriched peptides from JY, HeLa, SK-MEL-37, and HL60 samples,
  with multiple collision energy settings applied.
  In total, 251,149 unique peptidoforms, considering sequence, charge, and modifications, were
  used for model training, ensuring comprehensive coverage of various peptide types. For each
  unique peptidoform, the highest-scoring PSM was retained for training, while 10,045 peptides
  were set aside for evaluation purposes.
  The data used for model training can be accessed through the following dataset identifiers. Data
  from JY immunopeptidomics used for training can be accessed with the dataset identifiers
  PXD043026 for ProteomeXchange and JPST002158 for jPOST. Data from the Carapito lab have been
  deposited to the ProteomeXchange repositories PXD046535 for HL60 immunopeptidomics and PXD046543
  for HeLa tryptic proteomics files.
  This model can be applied to tryptic, elastase, and HLA class I immunopeptide spectra acquired
  on timsTOF instruments.

    **Input notes**
  All modifcations need to be explicitly encoded in the sequence. Valid sequences lengths are 1 to 30 AA. Supported are all modification from UNIMOD but modifications are only used to shift fragment mz they do not affect intensity.
  There are no limitations to valid Precursor Charges.
  **Output notes**
  Intensity was normalized to the sum of predicted intensity value.
  The model predicts y and b ions index 1-30 and charge 1. A maks is applied for impossible peaks (i.e. exceeding peptide length).
