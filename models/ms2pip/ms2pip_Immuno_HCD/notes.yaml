description: |
  This model was trained on observed spectrum intensities from five projects, all using HCD (beam-type CID) fragmentation and Orbitrap acquisition of immunopeptides (PXD012308, PXD006939, PXD009925, and PXD000394). 
  The model was evaluated on four distinct datasets with HLA-I immunopeptides (PXD005231), HLA-II immunopeptides (PXD020011), chymotrypsin peptides (PXD010154), and trypsin peptides (PXD008034), respectively.

  **Input notes**
  All modifcations need to be explicitly encoded in the sequence. Valid sequences lengths are up to 30 AA. Supported are all modification from UNIMOD but modifications are only used to shift fragment mz they do not affect intensity.
  There are no limitations to valid Precursor Charges.
  
  **Output notes**
  Intensity was normalized to the sum of predicted intensity value.
  The model predicts y and b ions index 1-30 and charge 1. A maks is applied for impossible peaks (i.e. exceeding peptide length).
