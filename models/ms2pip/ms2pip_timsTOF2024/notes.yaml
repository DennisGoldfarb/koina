  The training data for this model builds upon the set from the timsTOF 2023 model. It
  includes  trypsin, elastase, and class I immunopeptide data (PXD046535 and PXD040385), expanded
  with class II immunopeptides from Hoenisch Gravel et al. (PXD038782). A total of 505,289
  highest-scoring peptidoforms were selected across all datasets, accounting for precursor charge
  as part of the peptidoform. These peptidoforms were then divided into a training set
  (480,024 peptidoforms) and a test set (25,265 peptidoforms) using a stratified split based on
  dataset origin to ensure balanced representation of class I, class II, trypsin-digested, and
  elastase-digested peptides in both subsets. All processed data is publicly available on
  Zenodo at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11277943">10.5281/zenodo.11277943</a>.

  **Input notes**
  All modifcations need to be explicitly encoded in the sequence. Valid sequences lengths are 1 to 30 AA. Supported are all modification from UNIMOD but modifications are only used to shift fragment mz they do not affect intensity.
  There are no limitations to valid Precursor Charges.
  **Output notes**
  Intensity was normalized to the sum of predicted intensity value.
  The model predicts y and b ions index 1-30 and charge 1. A maks is applied for impossible peaks (i.e. exceeding peptide length).
