  This model was trained on 215 713 unique peptides acquired on a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer
  in beam-type CID mode (PXD000954). It was evaluated on 15 111 unique peptides from PXD001587.

    **Input notes**
  All modifcations need to be explicitly encoded in the sequence. Valid sequences lengths are 1 to 30 AA. Supported are all modification from UNIMOD but modifications are only used to shift fragment mz they do not affect intensity.
  There are no limitations to valid Precursor Charges.
  **Output notes**
  Intensity was normalized to the sum of predicted intensity value.
  The model predicts y and b ions index 1-30 and charge 1. A maks is applied for impossible peaks (i.e. exceeding peptide length).
